Internet of Things aim towards making life simpler by automating every small task around us.
As much is IoT helping in automating tasks, the benefits of IoT can also be extended for enhancing
the existing safety standards. Safety, the elementary concern of any project, has not been left
untouched by IoT. Gas Leakages in open or closed areas can prove to be dangerous and lethal. The
traditional Gas Leakage Detector Systems though have great precision, fail to acknowledge a few
factors in the field of alerting the people about the leakage. Therefore we have used the IoT
technology to make a Gas Leakage Detector for society which having Smart Alerting techniques
involving sending text message to the concerned authority and an ability performing data analytics on
sensor readings. Our main aim is to proposing the gas leakage system for society where each flat have
gas leakage detector hardware. This will detect the harmful gases in environment and alerting to the
society member through alarm and sending notification.
